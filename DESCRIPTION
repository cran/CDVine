Description: Functions for statistical inference of canonical vine (C-vine)
        and D-vine copulas. Tools for bivariate exploratory data analysis and for bivariate
        as well as vine copula selection are provided. Models can be estimated
        either sequentially or by joint maximum likelihood estimation.
        Sampling algorithms and plotting methods are also included.
        Data is assumed to lie in the unit hypercube (so-called copula
        data).
