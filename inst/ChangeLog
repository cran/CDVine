Version 1.1-9 (July 3, 2012)

- Fixed compatibility issue with VineCopula.


Version 1.1-8 (July 2, 2012)

- Update of references cited in the manual.

- Implementation of a more stable version of Kendall's tau for the BB7 copula (BiCopPar2Tau).

- Improved implementation of the bivariate copula selection function (BiCopSelect).

- Implementation of the rotated versions of the BB1, BB6, BB7 and BB8 copulas (rotation by 90, 180 and 270 degrees).
  (Rotation by 180 degrees corresponds to the survival copula.)
